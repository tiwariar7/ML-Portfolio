        <h2>About the Project</h2><br><br>
        <p>This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having a certain disease based on their symptoms. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model analyzes a comprehensive list of symptoms, such as itching, skin rash, continuous sneezing, joint pain, high fever, and fatigue, among others. By leveraging advanced Machine Learning algorithms, the application identifies patterns in the data to provide accurate predictions of diseases, including but not limited to fungal infections, allergies, diabetes, and bronchial asthma.
            <br>
            Our goal is to enhance early detection and medical decision-making by providing a reliable, symptom-based diagnostic tool. This tool can be particularly beneficial for preliminary screenings, guiding users to seek appropriate medical attention promptly.</p>

            <h1>Problem Statement of Project</h1>
            <p>
                Develop an advanced machine learning solution to accurately predict human diseases based on reported symptoms. 
                This solution will leverage multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction reliability and ensure robust inference. 
                By integrating diverse algorithms, the approach aims to optimize diagnostic precision and provide seamless, user-friendly 
                predictions in JSON format for real-world applicability. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated using 
                proven metrics to ensure high-quality results.

        <p><strong>Approach Used:</strong></p><br>
        <p><strong>Conceived Data Preparation:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Gathered and engineered a dataset from Kaggle, comprising two CSV filesâ€”one for training and another for testing. Integrated 133 columns, where 132 represent symptoms and the final column denotes prognosis.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Crafted Data Cleaning Process:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Diagnosed data quality and engineered transformations to ensure precision. The prognosis column, originally in string format, was customized into numerical values using a label encoder to enable model compatibility.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Developed Machine Learning Models:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Formulated a plan to train Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Innovated a method using a confusion matrix to forecast model performance effectively.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Engineered Prediction Pipeline:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Devised a strategy to combine predictions from all three models, enhancing robustness and accuracy. Crafted a user-friendly function that takes symptom input, diagnoses disease using trained models, and outputs predictions in JSON format.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Implementation Guidelines:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Planned the workflow: Download the train and test datasets, place them in the dataset folder, and execute code cells in Jupyter Notebook for clarity and visualized results.</p>
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <p><strong>Conceptualized Dataset Utilization:</strong></p><br>
        <p>The dataset is divided into three subsets: Training Data, Test Data, and Validation Data to ensure a well-structured and effective approach.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Engineered Data Preprocessing:</strong></p><br>
        <p>The Training Data (80%) undergoes preprocessing and is split to prepare for model training and evaluation.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Innovated Model Selection Process:</strong></p><br>
        <p>K-Fold Cross-Validation is performed on the training data to identify the most effective model.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Devised Multi-Model Training:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Three machine learning models are trained in parallel: Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Customized Metrics Computation:</strong></p><br>
        <p>The Test Data (20%) is used to compute performance metrics for each trained model, ensuring precise evaluation of individual models.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Forecasted Predictions on Validation Data:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Each trained classifier predicts outcomes on the Validation Dataset. Predictions from all three models are compared and aggregated.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Integrated Final Prediction:</strong></p><br>
        <p>The mode of all predictions is computed, combining results to generate the Final Prediction, enhancing accuracy and reliability.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The given flowchart illustrates a well-constructed pipeline for implementing robust and accurate predictions using a combination of preprocessing, model training, and ensemble techniques.</p>
